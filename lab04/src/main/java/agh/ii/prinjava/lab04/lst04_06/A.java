/**
 * Subtyping is a key feature of object-oriented languages such as Java. In Java, one type is a subtype of another
 * if they are related by an extends or implements clause.
 * Subtyping is transitive, meaning that if one type is a subtype of a second, and the second is a subtype of a third,
 * then the first is a subtype of the third.
 *
 * <p><i>Substitution principle</i>: a variable of a given type may be assigned a value of any subtype of that type,
 * and a method with a parameter of a given type may be invoked with an argument of any subtype of that type.
