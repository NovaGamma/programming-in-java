Encapsulation is a concept of OOP, it's used to only allow modification to an object to be done internally or via functions to avoid leaving access to objects attributes.

The setter method is one of the special function used to interact with an object, it change the value of the attribute to the value given.

The getter metohd is the other special function, that return the value of the attribute.

this is a keyword used to refer to the object in its methods to avoid having problem with variable declaration this.x and x with x given as a parameter

super is a keyword used to acces to a method of the parent class (in the concept of inheritance)

Inheritance is a concept used in OOP that allo classes to inherit others, with the metods, to put them in group, for example a parent class Animal, with Dog and Cat that will inherit certain methods from Animal that would be the same. It permit to avoid creating multiple time the same method.

Polymorphism refer to the ability of a variable to be different types, with the example of Shape the parent abstrac class, all the children class can be created with the type as Shape.

The relation between inheritance and inclusion polymorphism is that inheritance is used in polymorphism to use the sub-classes from the abstract parent class.


2)
static variable is a variable that is not an instance of the object its present in all objects and only on exists

static constant is a constant that can be accessed by all instances of a class

static method is a method that can be accessed by all instances of a class

static constant often have public visibility because they are constant and it does not pose a problem for it to be public


5)

the difference between == and equals is that == check the values, or the value of the attributes, while equals check if the two  things are the same, like not two instances of a class with the same attributes value.

o1.equals(o2) equivalent hashcode(o1) == hashcode(o2)

since the hashCode are unique if the hashcode of the two objects is the same it means that they are the same objects, thus it's equals
