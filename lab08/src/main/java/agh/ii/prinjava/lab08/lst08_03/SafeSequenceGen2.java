/**
 * As above, but with the use of the <em>synchronized statement</em>.
 *
 * <p>Notes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Synchronization is built around an internal entity known as the <em>intrinsic lock</em> or <em>monitor lock</em>
 *     (the API specification often refers to this entity simply as a <em>monitor</em>)</li>
 *
 *     <li>Every object has an intrinsic lock associated with it. By convention, a thread that needs exclusive and
 *     consistent access to an object's fields has to acquire the object's intrinsic lock before accessing them,
 *     and then release the intrinsic lock when it's done with them</li>
 * </ul>
